## Introduction

This section contains executable examples that demonstrate how to use the FloodAdapt API in practice.
These notebooks are meant to complement the [User Guide](../4_user_guide/index.qmd) and [API Reference](../api_ref/api_index.qmd) by showing real-world use cases, recommended workflows, and tips for getting started with your own data.

Each example focuses on a specific aspect of the FloodAdapt workflow, such as setting up a site, defining events, projections and measures, creating adaptation strategies, or evaluating risk and benefits.
The notebooks can be run independently, but they are organized in a logical sequence for those following the full workflow from start to finish.

## How to Run

All notebooks in this section are runnable with standard Python tools such as `jupyter` or `quarto preview`.
They assume that FloodAdapt and its `core` dependencies as well as the optional `docs` dependencies are correctly installed.
Refer to the [Setup Guide](../3_setup_guide/index.qmd) for help with installation and configuration.
To run these locally, make sure to select the correct python interpreter.

Each notebook includes narrative explanations and inline code cells. You can copy/modify the code to adapt it to your own use cases.
