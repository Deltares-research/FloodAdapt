A PhysicalProjection has the `sea_level_rise` and `subsidence` fields, which are relevant for all types of events, and the `rainfall_multiplier` and `storm_frequency_increase` fields which are applicable only for events sets (risk scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "The socio-economic part of the Projection is described by the `socio_economic_change` field which should be a [SocioEconomicChange](../api_ref/objects/SocioEconomicChange.qmd) object.
