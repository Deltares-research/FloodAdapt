I put some styling infos here:
but you can check all formatting here:

https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html

## Generate tables
https://tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables

## Headings

first level : # Heading
second level : ## Heading
third level : ### Heading

...

## Fonts

**bold**: ** word ** (remove tab spaces betweenw asterisk and word)

*italic*:  * this will be italic when tab space removed *

## Paragraphs
If you want to create a paragraph or continue in the next line add 2 tab spaces behind the last word.

E.g I write and want to continue in the next line.

If I only press enter to continue in the next line as I did now this will not show.
-> I have to add 2 spaces after **line.**

Let's see what happens when I add the 2 tabs:

I to continue in the next **line.**
If I only press enter to continue in the next line as I did now this will not show.

## Additional options

### Emphasizing
Create different types to emphasize the text eg code

Example 1: `conda install jupyter`  : Use ` (grave accent) before and after your sentence (without any spacing)

Example 2:
    something: just indent one time. for scrolling do the same just write a longer text (see below)

    something really long that will needs scrolling so I will just continue writing until the scrolling bar appears.

### Bullet Points
Just write numbers below one another and use Indentation for the levels.

1. Merry
2. Christmas
3. Kathryn
    i) and a new year too

Use the asterisks for your first level. For the second level in the row below add an indentation and a + per entry.

* Merry  (* Merry)
    + Christmas   (+ Christmas)
    + Kathryn     (+ Kathryn)

## Figures

add a figure and give it a name add #fig..to cross-reference.  Just included here for demonstration purposes):

First an exclamation mark - [here comes the name] (here comes the path to the file){#fig-logo}

add "fig-" before the label name to be able to cross reference.

Cross reference to another page or figure:

"[Write here the text wou want to see]"("add the reference")

### Cross reference page
"[Setup Guide]"(/3_setup_guide/index.qmd)"
Here I use the reference to the [Setup Guide](/3_setup_guide/index.qmd)

### Cross reference Figure
use the @ before the logo Reference and use the name you gave it as reference above:
@ fig-logo (remove space)
