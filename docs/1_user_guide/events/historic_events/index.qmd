## Which historical event type should I choose?
Are you interested in a hurricane that made landfall at or near the site? Then choose Historical hurricane.

Are you interested in a historical event that wasn't a hurricane, like a king tide or a heavy rainfall event? If your site has a water level gauge, we recommend using the "Historical event with gauged water levels" option. The only time the "Historical event without gauged water levels" option is recommended is when there is no gauge at the site. @fig-whichEvent shows a flow chart for deciding which event type to choose.
