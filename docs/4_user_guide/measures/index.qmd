FloodAdapt can simulate several types of adaptation measures. These fall under three categories within FloodAdapt:

* [Hydraulic measures](hydraulic.qmd) - floodwalls, levees, pumps
* [Urban green infrastructure](green_infra.qmd)
* [Building-level measures](buildings.qmd) - building elevation, floodproofing, and buyouts
