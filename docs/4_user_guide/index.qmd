This user guide covers the installation and use of FloodAdapt. Below we highlight the information that you can find in this guide. 

## Overview
FloddAdapt allows users to evaluate flooding and impacts for scenarios they define, to help understand the community vulnerability now and in the future, and the effectiveness and benefits of adaptation options.

**Scenarios consist of events, projections, and strategies, which are all specified via the user interface.**
:::
 The user guide describes how to specify events, projections, and strategies and how to view and compare scenario results. There are ten tabs in the user interface: Site, Events, Projections, Measures, Strategies, Scenarios, Output, Compare - maps, Compare - tables, and Benefits. @fig-GUItabs presents the tabs of the user interface and highlights the information needed to run and view results.

* The [Site tab](site_tab.qmd) is an informative tab where the user is not required to input any information. 

* The [Events](events/index.qmd), [Projections](projections/index.qmd), [Measures](measures/index.qmd), and [Strategy](strategy/index.qmd) tabs are **input** tabs where the user will specify the 'ingredients' for their scenarios. 

* The [Scenarios](scenarios/index.qmd) tab is a management tab, where the user can specify and run scenarios. 

::: {.callout}
Running a scenario calls the SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models to start the simulations for the specified scenarios.
