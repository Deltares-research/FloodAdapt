FloodAdapt can simulate future climate and socio-economic conditions.

![**FloodAdapt can simulate future [climate projections]{.underline} - sea level rise, increased tropical storm frequencies, precipitation changes, and [socio-economic projections]{.underline} - population growth and economic growth**](C:/Users/rautenba/repos/FloodAdapt/docs/_static/images/projections.png){#fig-projections}

On the Projections Tab in FloodAdapt, click 'Add Projection' to open the projections window (see @fig-projectionWindow)

![**Projections window on the Projections tab in FloodAdapt**](C:/Users/rautenba/repos/FloodAdapt/docs/_static/images/Projection_window.png){#fig-projectionWindow}

In this window you can specify a [climate projection](climate.qmd), a [socio-economic projection](socioEconomic.qmd), or a combination (for example: 10% population growth with 1 foot of SLR).

Click the following links to learn more about how climate and socio-economic projections can be specified in FloodAdapt, and how they are represented in the modeling.

[Climate projections](climate.qmd)

[Socio-economic projections](socioEconomic.qmd)
