A probabilistic event set is the combination of a set of synthetic events and their occurrence probabilities. These can be both tropical storms (hurricanes), as well as non-tropical events. They should include all event types that can lead to flooding in the site area (now or in the future), and can be *compound* flood events, meaning a combination of different flood drivers, like water level, rainfall, river discharge, or wind. It can be complicated to set up this set of events, and is therefore recommended to be done by an expert during the set-up of FloodAdapt for the site location.

In the events tab in FloodAdapt, a probabilistic event set can be recognized by the Type specification at the bottom of the window (see @fig-probEventSet). These event sets cannot be modified or deleted via the user interface.

## How are probabilistic event sets used in FloodAdapt?
When a user selects a scenario with a probabilistic event set, FloodAdapt calculate return period flood maps (such as the *100 year flood map*), return period damages, and expected annual damages (risk) for the scenario. For example, if a user wants to explore the risk with 1 foot of sea level rise with a floodwall in place, their scenario components would be: projection = 1 ft. sea level rise, strategy = floodwall, event = probabilistic event set. The calculation of risk allows a user to explore the risk-reduction benefits of adaptation options, as well as obtaining more comprehensive insight into how at-risk different areas are when considering all relevant event types and their probability of occurring. The page on [scenarios](../scenarios/index.qmd) gives more examples how users can define scenarios to answer different questions.
