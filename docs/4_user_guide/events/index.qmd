In the event tab, a user can add different types of events. These can be either [**historical**](historic_events/index.qmd) or [**synthetic**](synthetic_events.qmd) events. It is also possible to select historical events and modify them to create what-if event scenarios. 

There are three historical event types, which are described in the coming sections:

* [Historical hurricane](historic_events/historic_events_hurricane.qmd)
* [Historical event with gauged water levels](historic_events/historic_events_gauged.qmd)
* [Historical event without gauged water levels](historic_events/historic_events_ungauged.qmd)

 When the user selects **Add event** in the event window, they will be prompted to choose from one of the three historical event types or the synthetic event type. Each selection opens a window where the user can specify event information. 

 ![**The four event types a user can select**](../../_static/images/eventTypeSelector.png){#fig-eventSelector}
 
 Each event type will have unique input that is required, but they also share some common input. The user must provide an event name, and - optionally - a description. Additionally, all historic events require a start and stop time of the event.

## Event names and descriptions
Event names must be unique and cannot have any spaces or special characters (underscores are allowed). Event descriptions are optional and have no syntax restrictions. For example, an event name could be **KingTideNov2021**, and the long name could be **King Tide - November 2021**.

::: {.callout-note}
## Event start and stop times
The format for the start and stop time is 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss', where YYYY = four-digit year, MM = two digit month, DD = two-digit day, hh = two-digit hour, mm = two-digit minutes, and ss = two-digit seconds. The user can type in a date, or select a date from a drop-down calendar.

## How are events modeled in FloodAdapt?
FloodAdapt supports two hydrodynamic models:

(1) An offshore model that calculates nearshore water levels based on astronomic tides, wind fields and pressure fields. These nearshore water levels are used to force the overland model.

(2) An overland model that calculates the inundation over land due to nearshore water levels, local wind, rainfall, and river discharge. 

When a user selects a [historical hurricane](historic_events_hurricane.qmd), FloodAdapt will pull in wind and pressure data for the offshore model, calculate the nearshore water levels for the overland model, and then run the overland model with wind and rainfall (calculated based on track information), and any user-input river discharges. 

When a user selects a [Historical event with gauged water levels](historic_events_gauged.qmd), only the overland model will be run, using the gauged water levels as input to the overland model. 

When a user selects a [Historical event without gauged water levels](historic_events_ungauged.qmd), the offshore model will first be run using the wind and pressure data from **ADD SOURCE HERE**. The calculated nearshore water levels will then be input to the overland model to calculate the overland flooding using the user-specified local wind, rainfall, and river discharge values. 

When a user selects a [Synthetic event](synthetic_events.qmd), only the overland model will be run, using the tide and surge information specified by the user.
