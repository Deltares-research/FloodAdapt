FloodAdapt is intended for end-users who have some technical background, but do not need to be subject-matter experts in flood and impact modeling. Set-up of FloodAdapt and developing a set of events and probabilities for risk assessment require additional capabilities. @fig-readerGuidance provides a reading guide for this documentation. It shows the intended reader and the relative technical skills required for the different sections in this documentation. 

The [Setup Guide](/3_setup_guide/index.qmd) is intended for those who will "build" or configure FloodAdapt for a new site and set of end-users. 

The [Installation Guide](/2_installation_guide/index.qmd) helps an end-user get FloodAdapt installed and ready to run on their machine and explains the folder structure of FloodAdapt. 

The [User Guide](/4_user_guide/index.qmd) walks the user through all the functionality of FloodAdapt. 

The section on [Updating FloodAdapt](/5_update_model/index.qmd) describes the steps involved in updating the database of FloodAdapt. This would be done whenever new or improved data becomes available. 

Chapter 6 provides a demonstration of a CFRSS application, to help the reader understand how FloodAdapt can support adaptation and resilience planning. Appendix A is a technical write-up walking a user through the preparation of a probabilistic event set for calculating risk with FloodAdapt. A tutorial video has been prepared that aligns with the demonstration in Chapter 6 and can be found at the following link: Add link.
