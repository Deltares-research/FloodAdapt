Welcome to the FloodAdapt backend user documentation. This section is intended for readers with a programming and/or modeling background who want to operate FloodAdapt without the user interface, by interacting directly with the FloodAdapt backend via use of the FloodAdapt API.

The backend-user documentation includes two main sections:

(1) [API reference documentation](api_ref/api_index.qmd)
(2) [API usage examples via Python notebooks](examples/index.qmd)

* Event scenarios (flooding and impacts)
* Risk scenarios (flooding, impacts, and risk)
* Equity-weighted expected annual damages
* Benefits
