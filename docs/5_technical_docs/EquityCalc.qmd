Equity methods seek to compensate for the unfair distribution in income when calculating flood damages. They rely on the concept of marginal utility of income, which holds that a loss of $1 for a rich person is not equivalent to the loss of $1 for a poor person. Utility is defined in economics as the satisfaction, usefulness, or happiness derived from - in this case - income. **Equity weights** are a way to correct for the inequality in marginal utility across income classes. Essentially, the equity weight represents the relative size of the marginal utility (a loss in utility due to a change in income - brought on in this case by flood damages) compared to the marginal utility for the community's average income level. This leads to equity weights greater than 1 for incomes below average, and less than 1 for higher-than-average incomes. The equity weights are then used as a multiplicative factor on flood damages.

FloodAdapt includes a module which automatically calculates equity weights and applies them to risk estimates, using methods described in literature ([1](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.446)). The calculation framework of the module is depicted in @fig-equityCalc.

Inputs to the method are:

* Mean per capita income ($M$) and population $(P)$ at aggregated scale, for example census block groups. This information can be obtained automatically when setting up the [Delft-FIAT model](C:/Users/rautenba/repos/FloodAdapt/docs/3_setup_guide/Delft_Fiat/hydromt_fiat_gui.qmd)

* Return period damages per building $D$ (output from the impact module in a [risk calculation](RiskScenario.qmd)).

The module then does the following:

* Calculates the weighted average income per capita, weighted by population $I_{WA} = \frac{\sum (M_i \cdot P_i)}{P}$, where $i$ represents the areas, for example census block groups.

* Derives the equity weight for each aggregated area: $EW_i = \left(\frac{M_i}{I_{WA}}\right)^\gamma$. Note that $\gamma$ is set to 1.2. This parameter is expected to be made configurable by FloodAdapt users in future releases.

* Calculates for each return period $j$ the equity-weighted damages per aggregation area $EWD_{i,j} = EW_i \cdot D_{i,j}$

* Integrates the equity-weighted damages over the return periods using log-linear interpolation to derive the equity-weighted expected annual damages for each aggreagation area.
