Using only the mandatory parameters (i.e., baseline FloodAdapt configuration) will result in a simple but functional version of FloodAdapt. By adding optional parameters to your configuration, you can create a more advanced FloodAdapt database with additional features. If you want to learn more about the configuration parameters, please refer to the [Database-Builder](../../../4_system_setup/database.qmd) of the Setup Guide in the documentation.\n",
