    "# 📘 Example: Creating a Hurricane Event in FloodAdapt\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a hurricane event using FloodAdapt. Hurricane events are valuable for controlled testing, sensitivity analysis, and understanding the behavior of flood models under simplified or hypothetical scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "A FloodAdapt Event consists of 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a [`TimeFrame`](../../api_ref/TimeFrame.qmd) describing the start and end time of the hazard simulation(s)\n",
    "- a collection of forcings to be applied to the hazard model(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we construct a full `HurricaneEvent` with `water level`, `rainfall`, `wind`, and river `discharge` forcings, and then save it to a FloodAdapt database."
