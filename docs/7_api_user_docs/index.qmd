Welcome to the FloodAdapt backend user documentation. This section is intended for readers with a programming and/or modeling background who want to operate FloodAdapt without the user interface, by interacting directly with the FloodAdapt backend via use of the FloodAdapt API.

The backend-user documentation includes two main sections:

(1) [API usage examples via Python notebooks](../examples/index.qmd)
(2) [API reference documentation](../api_ref/api_index.qmd)
