The FloodAdapt application can be freely downloaded and used in any coastal community. However, for FloodAdapt to operate, it requires a site-specific database. The FloodAdapt database must contain at minimum an overland flood model (currently the open-source compound flood SFINCS model is supported), a flood impact model (currently the open-source Delft-FIAT model is supported), and some site specific information such as the name and location of the site. The amount of information included in the FloodAdapt database will determine the degree to which its functionalities will be activated (this is described in detail in the [database setup section](database.qmd)). Most notably, to be able to run risk and benefit calculations, an event set must be prepared. 

To make it easier for communities to get started with FloodAdapt, supporting tools and guidance have been created. This setup guide walks a technical user through the setup process for FloodAdapt, focusing on three key database ingredients: The SFINCS model, the Delft-FIAT model, and the probabilistic event set for risk analysis. Special model-builder software has been created to prepare a SFINCS and Delft-FIAT model, as well as special software to create the FloodAdapt database once these models have been set up. @fig-setupOverview shows the workflow for getting a FloodAdapt system operational in a new community. The preparation of the event set is optional. FloodAdapt will be able to run event scenarios with full functionality without an event set.

The setup guide consists of the following sections:

1. [SFINCS Setup](SFINCS/index.qmd) - this gives an overvivew of the SFINCS model and walks the user through the use of the SFINCS model-builder to create an overland SFINCS model.

2. [Delft FIAT Setup](Delft_Fiat/index.qmd) - this section gives an overview of the Delft-FIAT model and walks the user through the use of the Delft-FIAT model-builder

3. [Event Setup](risk_analysis.qmd) - provides guidance and examples how to create a probabilistic event set for risk analysis in a compound flood area

4. [Database Setup](database.qmd) - describes the preparation of a database-builder configuration file that can be used with the database-builder tool to create a FloodAdapt database
