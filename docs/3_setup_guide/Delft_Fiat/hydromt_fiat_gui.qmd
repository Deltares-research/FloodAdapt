The Hydromt FIAT Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes the **Delft FIAT** model creation accessible for non-modeling experts and facilitates the process of setting up the **Delft FIAT** model. 

The Hydromt FIAT GUI can be downloaded from the [Deltares website](https://www.deltares-usa.us/product-page/floodadapt-software).

### Installation
To install the Hydromt FIAT GUI simply run the executable **(......exe)** and the software is ready to go. 

### Create the model boundaries

Before you start you must select a model output directory by clicking **File** >> **Select Working Directory**.  
Now you are ready to set up the model. 

There are multiple options on how to create the model boundaries:

  * Draw polygon/ draw box  
  * Upload Sfincs boundaries  
  * Upload file (polygon vector file)

In the following video you can see how to generate the model boundaries by simply drawing a polygon.

Create model boundaries using the "Draw Polygon" method.

### Quickbuild
If you set up a model in the United States and do not want to use your own data you can simply choose to work with the **quickbuild**. 

The **quickbuild** downloads the 

* **exposure data** from the National Structure Inventory
* **vulnerability curves** from the FEMAâ€™s Hazus Program
* **social vulnerability index** and **equity** from the census api. 
* **road data** from Open Street Map (OSM)

After you generated the model boundaries you can select the quickbuild option in the same tab in the GUI (@fig-nsi_quickbuild)

::: {#fig-nsi_quickbuild}

{{< video ../../_static/videos/hydromt_fiat/Quickbuild.mp4 >}}

Quickbuild NSI data.

### Create the exposure data
There are two different databases to download the exposure data from, depending on where you want to set up your model:

1. National Structure Inventory (United States)
2. Open Street Map (international)

You can also download road data from Open Street Map. Simply check the checkbox "Include OSM roads" in the GUI ().

The videos below show the exposure setup using the National Structure Inventory (NSI) database (@fig-nsi_exposure) and the Open  Street Map (OSM) database (@fig-osm_exposure).
