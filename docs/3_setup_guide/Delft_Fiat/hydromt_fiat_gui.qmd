The Hydromt FIAT Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes the **Delft FIAT** model creation accessible for non-modeling experts and facilitates the process of setting up the **Delft FIAT** model. 

The Hydromt FIAT GUI can be downloaded from the [Deltares website](https://www.deltares-usa.us/product-page/floodadapt-software).

### Installation
To install the Hydromt FIAT GUI simply run the executable **(......exe)** and the software is ready to go. 

### Create the model boundaries

Before you start you must select a model output directory by clicking **File** >> **Select Working Directory**.  
Now it's time to set up the model. 

* There are multiple options on how to create the model boundaries:  
  + Draw polygon/ draw box  
  + Upload Sfincs boundaries  
  + Upload file (vector file of a closed polygon)

In the following video you can see how to generate the model boundaries by simply drawing a polygon.
