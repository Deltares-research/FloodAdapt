The Hydromt FIAT Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes the **Delft FIAT** model creation accessible for non-modeling experts and facilitates the process of setting up the **Delft FIAT** model. 

The Hydromt FIAT GUI can be downloaded from the [Deltares website](https://www.deltares-usa.us/product-page/floodadapt-software).

### Installation
To install the Hydromt FIAT GUI simply run the executable **(......exe)** and the software is ready to go. 

### Create the model boundaries

Before you start you must select a model output directory by clicking **File** >> **Select Working Directory**.  
Now you are ready to set up the model. 

There are multiple options on how to create the model boundaries:

  * Draw polygon/ draw box  
  * Upload Sfincs boundaries  
  * Upload file (polygon vector file)

In the following video you can see how to generate the model boundaries by simply drawing a polygon.

Create model boundaries using the "Draw Polygon" method.

### Quickbuild
If you set up a model in the United States and do not want to use your own data you can simply choose to work with the **quickbuild**. 

The **quickbuild** downloads the 

* **exposure data** from the National Structure Inventory
* **vulnerability curves** from the FEMAâ€™s Hazus Program
* **social vulnerability index** and **equity** from the census api. 
* **road data** from Open Street Map (OSM)

After you generated the model boundaries you can select the quickbuild option in the same tab in the GUI (@fig-nsi_quickbuild)

Quickbuild option in the United States.

### Create the exposure data
There are two different databases to download the **exposure data** from, depending on where you want to set up your model:

1. **National Structure Inventory (United States)**
2. **Open Street Map (international)**

Additionally, you can download **road data** from Open Street Map. To do so, simply check the checkbox "Include OSM roads" in the GUI ().

The videos below show the exposure setup using the National Structure Inventory (NSI) database (@fig-nsi_exposure) and the Open  Street Map (OSM) database (@fig-osm_exposure).

### Assign vulnerability curves
As a next step you must assign the vulnerability curves to the exposure data. There are two data sources from which the vulnerability curves are downloaded from, depending on the location of your model:

1. **FEMA Hazus Curves (United States)**
2. **JRC Vulnerability Curves (international)**

The GUI will automatically select the correct default curves for your model based upon your exposure data. Therefore, you only need to add the curves to the model without further adjustment. You can follow the steps in the video below (@fig-vulnerability).

::: {#fig-vulnerability}

{{< video ../../_static/videos/hydromt_fiat/NSI_Vulnerability.mp4 >}}

Assign the default vulnerability curves to the exposure data. 

:::

### Create model
At this point, you are ready to create the **Delft FIAT model**. Verify the data sources in the bottom tab, to make sure they match your expectations. If so, create your model (@fig-create_model).

::: {#fig-create_model}

Create your Delft FIAT model.

### Additional features

#### Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and Equity
Delft FIAT allows you to evaluate the equitible distribution of damages and benefits by using the **social vulnerability index** and **equity**. If your model site is located in the United States SVI data can be calculated based upon recent literature. 
However, the user has the freedom to upload any **social vulnerability index** and/or **equity** layer and assign a value to each asset that overlaps the layer (@fig-additional_attr).

#### Additional attribtues
Not only social vulnerability and/or equity can be linked to the exposure data. Any additional layer (e.g. landuse, administrative boundaries or others) can be imposed on the exposure data (@fig-additional_attr).
