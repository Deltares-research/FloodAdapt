It is recommended to set up a folder structure as shown below to ensure that FIAT can find each data file and run smoothly. The files inside the folders are example files and do not need to be of those data types or named as such.

```

├───📁 FIAT/
    |
    ├───📁 hazard/
    │   └───📄 hazard_map.nc
    |
    ├───📁 exposure/
    │   ├───📄 buildings.gpkg
    │   └───📄 exposure.csv
    |
    ├───📁 vulnerability/
    │   └───📄 vulnerability_curves.csv
    |
    └───📄 settings.toml

```
