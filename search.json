    "text": "A probabilistic event set is the combination of a set of synthetic events and their occurrence probabilities. These can be both tropical storms (hurricanes), as well as non-tropical events. They should include all event types that can lead to flooding in the site area (now or in the future), and can be compound flood events, meaning a combination of different flood drivers, like water level, rainfall, river discharge, or wind. It can be complicated to set up this set of events, and is therefore recommended to be done by an expert during the set-up of FloodAdapt for the site location.\nIn the events tab in FloodAdapt, a probabilistic event set can be recognized by the Type specification at the bottom of the window (see Figure 1). These event sets cannot be modified or deleted via the user interface.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Probabilistic event set in the Events window. The Type is specified as Probabilistic Event Set and cannot be modified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are probabilistic event sets used in FloodAdapt?\n\n\n\nWhen a user selects a scenario with a probabilistic event set, FloodAdapt calculate return period flood maps (such as the 100 year flood map), return period damages, and expected annual damages (risk) for the scenario. For example, if a user wants to explore the risk with 1 foot of sea level rise with a floodwall in place, their scenario components would be: projection = 1 ft. sea level rise, strategy = floodwall, event = probabilistic event set. The calculation of risk allows a user to explore the risk-reduction benefits of adaptation options, as well as obtaining more comprehensive insight into how at-risk different areas are when considering all relevant event types and their probability of occurring. The page on scenarios gives more examples how users can define scenarios to answer different questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

When the user selects the “Historical hurricane” option from the Events tab, they will see a hurricane selection window appear (see Figure 1), which is populated with historical hurricanes from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) HURDAT2 database.

Choose dates from 1-2 days before landfall to 1 day after landfall.\n\n\nUnder the “Surge and Tide” block, the user can shift the hurricane track by specifying the miles of horizontal or vertical shift. The shifted hurricane will be displayed beside the original track.\nThe wind and rain are automatically derived from information about the hurricane track. The rainfall is derived from the track using the IPET method. The user does not need to specify any information here.\nThe river discharge represents the discharge at the model boundary and will be automatically filled to a default value specified during system set-up. The user can modify this value.

    "text": "Overview\nFloodAdapt is a flood adaptation decision-support tool, which aims to advance and accelerate flooding-related adaptation planning. It integrates rapid, physics-based compound flood modeling and detailed impact modeling into a user-friendly system, ensuring accessibility for end-users, regardless of their technical backgrounds. This enables users to define and evaluate meaningful “what-if” scenarios, which can be combinations of weather events, climate or socio-economic future conditions, and adaptation strategies. FloodAdapt rapidly generates high-quality flood and impact maps, equity-focused aggregations, and informative metrics, providing valuable support for planning and facilitating genuine stakeholder engagement. Beyond its usefulness for end-users, FloodAdapt acts as a vital bridge between scientific advancements and practical needs, enhancing the adoption and impact of adaptation research and development.\n\nFloodAdapt was developed as a rapid planning tool with a straightforward graphical user interface for scenario generation, simulation, and visualization of spatial flooding and flooding impacts. Decision-making needs at the community level were central to the design of FloodAdapt. Users can answer planning questions like: “How will potential adaptation options reduce flood impacts?”, “How will those options perform for different types of events, like hurricanes, king tides, or heavy rainfall?”, “Which neighborhoods will benefit most?”, “How will those options hold up in the future?”\nUsers specify what-if scenarios composed of historic or synthetic weather events, climate or socio-economic future projections, and adaptation measures. They are able to evaluate flooding and impacts due to compound weather events, like hurricanes, king tides, and rainfall events. Users can evaluate flooding, impacts, and risk considering user-specified projections of sea level rise, precipitation increase, storm frequency increase, population growth, and economic growth.

    "text": "Intended Uses of FloodAdapt\nFloodAdapt was developed to support adaptation and resilience planning, to provide community understanding of the flooding and impacts resulting from different scenarios of interest, to understand the urgency of actions in different areas, to prioritize investments, and to assess the effectiveness and longevity of different adaptation options.\nFloodAdapt is a powerful and physics-based system that can provide realistic flood and impact responses for user-defined scenarios. This is important because accuracy builds community trust in the tool. The underlying models and data in FloodAdapt can be continuously improved by the local or regional agencies who are operating it. The accuracy of the model results will depend on the accuracy of the input data. FloodAdapt can also help illuminate which data are missing or need improvement and should be collected when resources allow.\nFloodAdapt is not intended for use in the detailed engineering design of adaptation measures, particularly hydraulic ones. Once FloodAdapt has helped the community identify strategies and priority areas for improvements, the specific design requirements for these strategies should be done using more comprehensive modeling tools available. These may need to include detailed drainage infrastructure systems, groundwater, or other components not currently built into FloodAdapt."

    "text": "FloodAdapt is a flood adaptation decision-support tool, which aims to advance and accelerate flooding-related adaptation planning. It integrates rapid, physics-based compound flood modeling and detailed impact modeling into a user-friendly system, ensuring accessibility for end-users, regardless of their technical backgrounds. This enables users to define and evaluate meaningful “what-if” scenarios, which can be combinations of weather events, climate or socio-economic future conditions, and adaptation strategies. FloodAdapt rapidly generates high-quality flood and impact maps, equity-focused aggregations, and informative metrics, providing valuable support for planning and facilitating genuine stakeholder engagement. Beyond its usefulness for end-users, FloodAdapt acts as a vital bridge between scientific advancements and practical needs, enhancing the adoption and impact of adaptation research and development.\n\nFloodAdapt was developed as a rapid planning tool with a straightforward graphical user interface for scenario generation, simulation, and visualization of spatial flooding and flooding impacts. Decision-making needs at the community level were central to the design of FloodAdapt. Users can answer planning questions like: “How will potential adaptation options reduce flood impacts?”, “How will those options perform for different types of events, like hurricanes, king tides, or heavy rainfall?”, “Which neighborhoods will benefit most?”, “How will those options hold up in the future?”\nUsers specify what-if scenarios composed of historic or synthetic weather events, climate or socio-economic future projections, and adaptation measures. They are able to evaluate flooding and impacts due to compound weather events, like hurricanes, king tides, and rainfall events. Users can evaluate flooding, impacts, and risk considering user-specified projections of sea level rise, precipitation increase, storm frequency increase, population growth, and economic growth. They can also test out adaptation options, like sea walls, levees, pumps, urban green infrastructure, home elevations, buyouts and floodproofing.\nThe backend of FloodAdapt leverages the open-source, state-of-the-art process-based compound flood model SFINCS that can accurately predict compound flooding due to surge, rainfall, and river discharge, at a fraction of the computation time typically required by physics-based models. The damage model included in FloodAdapt is the Deltares-developed flood impact assessment tool Delft-FIAT. It calculates the flood damages to individual buildings and roads, and – when social vulnerability data is available – aggregates these damages over vulnerability classes.\nWhen a user specifies a what-if scenario, the backend of FloodAdapt automatically makes changes to the SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models to represent the user choices, the way an expert modeller would. It then simulates the scenario and returns flood and impact maps, scenario comparison visualizations, summary metrics, and an infographic to highlighting flooding or impacts of particular concern to a community. In this way, FloodAdapt allows end-users to unleash the power of advanced models without requiring the technical background, or the laborious pre- and post-processing of models that is usually required for this type of analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic showing the design concepts behind the FloodAdapt software\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Overview of the FloodAdapt GUI\nThe FloodAdapt GUI supports the creation, running, visualization, and comparison of scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a scenario in FloodAdapt?\n\n\n\nScenarios in FloodAdapt are defined as a combination of an event, a projection, and a strategy, all of which are specified via the user interface.\n\n\nScenarios are used to answer user questions about how flooding and impacts are or will change with adaptation measures and under future conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample user question\n\n\n\nHow would a floodwall have held up in a recent hurricane if the track had made a worst-case landfall?\nTo answer this question, the user would create a scenario: a recent hurricane shifted to make worst-case landfall (event), under current conditions (projection), with and a floodwall (strategy). Viewing the flooding, impacts and summary information will help them evaluate if the floodwall would have been sufficientn to protect against this event.\n\n\nThe user guide describes how to specify events, projections, and strategies and how to view and compare scenario results.\nThere are ten tabs in the user interface: Site, Events, Projections, Measures, Strategies, Scenarios, Output, Compare - maps, Compare - tables, and Benefits. Figure 1 presents the tabs of the user interface and highlights the information needed to run and view results.\n\nThe Site tab is an informative tab where the user is not required to input any information.\nThe Events, Projections, Measures, and Strategy tabs are input tabs where the user will specify the ‘ingredients’ for their scenarios.\nThe Scenarios tab is a management tab, where the user can specify and run scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning a scenario calls the SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models to start the simulations for the specified scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tabs of the FloodAdapt user interface. Orange fill indicates required user input, and the arrows show the flow of information from one tab to another\n\n\n\nThe Output tab is where a user can view maps showing the flooding and impacts and see infometrics and an infographic for scenarios that have been run.\nThe user can compare scenarios spatially (map comparison) in the Compare - map tab and can compare scenarios based on their tabulated metrics in the Compare - table tab.\nThe user can evaluate the risk-reduction benefits of an adaptation strategy, including spatial distribution of benefits, and equity-weighted benefits in the Benefits tab."

    "section": "Sea level rise",
    "text": "Sea level rise\nThere are two ways to specify sea level rise in the projections window: manually and from scenario.\nIf you select manually, you can type a number in the “Sea Level Rise” (see Figure 2). You can then give your projection a name and (optionally) a description and click “OK” and your projection will show up in the FlodoAdapt Projections tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Manually entering a sea level rise projection\n\n\nIf you select from scenario, a dropdown box will appear from which you can select the sea level rise scenario you want to use (see Figure 3). These options are configurable and are specified at system setup. Once you select a scenario, you specify a year and FloodAdapt will automatically calculate the sea level rise for that year, using the selected sea level rise scenario. You can then give your projection a name and (optionally) a description and click “OK” and your projection will show up in the FlodoAdapt Projections tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Using a sea level rise scenario and a year to enter a sea level rise projection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea level rise - since when?\n\n\n\nSea level rise scenarios have a starting point where sea level rise is zero (often, but not necessarily, starting at the year 2000). FloodAdapt corrects for this, using the ‘current year’, which is specified at system setup. So when a user chooses the “from scenario” option to input a sea level rise projection for a future year, the sea level rise that is shown in the projections window is relative to the current year. This is done by subtracting the projected rise between the starting point and the current year, for each sea level rise scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the sea level rise projection represented in the modeling?\n\n\n\nWhen a user runs a scenario with a sea level rise projection, the sea level rise is added to the flood model’s coastal boundary condition. FloodAdapt treats this addition differently depending on the type of event. For a recent event using gauged water levels, the sea level rise in the current year relative to mean sea level is already represented in the measured water levels, so only the relative rise between the current year and future year is added. For a recent event without gauged water levels and for a historical hurricane, the offshore model calculates the nearshore coastal water levels relative to mean sea level. To correct for the sea level rise in the current year relative to mean sea level, an ‘offset’ is added which is specified at system set-up. On top of this, the relative sea level rise between the current year and the future year is added to represent the future conditions."

You can give the projection a name and (optionally) a description and click “OK” and the projection will be added in the projections tab.\n\nWhy is this only for probabilistic event sets?\nIn the projection window, you see an indication that increased precipitation is for probabilistic events only. This is because for a single event, a user can explore a ‘what-if’ scenario about increased rainfall by adjusting the rainfall when they define an event (with the precipitation magnifier for a historical event, or with complete flexibility in defining rainfall for a synthetic event). For probabilistic event sets, the precpitation change needs to be applied to every event in the set, something that the user cannot do via the events tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I choose this projection for a single event scenario?\n\n\n\nIf you choose a projection of increased precipitation for a single event, it will work exactly as expected, and is identical to the precipitation magnifier option when you define your event. If you prefer to specify the increased precipitation via the projections tab instead of as a precipitation magnifier in the event tab, that is completely fine! Just be careful not to choose both, or the increase will be applied twice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Entering increased precipitation as a percentage increase"

    "text": "Increased storm frequency\nAn increase in storm frequency is given as a percentage in the projections window (see Figure 5). This percentage is treated as an increase in the occurrence frequency of each tropical storm event in a probabilistic event set. This influences the return period flood maps and risk estimates, because when storms occur more frequently, the chance of storm flooding, and hence risk, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample - increased storm frequency\n\n\n\nFor example, if you select a storm frequency increase of 10%, and a tropical storm in the event set had an occurrence frequency of once in 50 years (0.02), the increased frequency of this storm would be 0.22, or once in about 45 years.\n\n\n\nWhy is this only for probabilistic event sets?\nThe change in storm frequency will only affect the frequency of the storm. This frequency is used in the derivation of return period flood maps and the calculation of expected annual damages. For a single event, this frequency is not used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I choose this projection for a single event scenario?\n\n\n\nIf you choose a projection of increased storm frequency for a single event, it will have no effect. The frequency is only used when calculating return period flood maps and risk, and for a single event scenario will play no role. It won’t do any harm, but it won’t have any effect on the resulting event-scenario flood and impact results.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Entering increased storm frequency as a percentage increase"
