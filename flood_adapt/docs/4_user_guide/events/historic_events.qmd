### Historical Hurricanes
::: {.callout-tip}
Don't feel like reading? No problem! Check out our video about how to add a hurricane in FloodAdapt, and also how to shift the hurricane to see how different the flooding and impacts would have been had the hurricane made landfall somewhere else.

The historical hurricane event allows the user to select and shift a historical hurricane from a hurricane track database. When the user selects the “Historical – Hurricane” option from the Events tab, they will see a hurricane selection window appear (see @fig-hurricaneSelector), which is populated with historical hurricanes from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) HURDAT2 database. This database is updated by the NHC annually and will require an annual maintenance update to keep the hurricane database in FloodAdapt up to date.  The default search radius around the project site is 100 miles. If a hurricane of interest does not appear by default, the user can increase the search radius to locate it. However, it is not recommended to use this option for a hurricane so far from the site because the hurricane track option performs best for hurricanes that passed close to the site. For distant hurricane tracks, it is recommended to use “Historical – forced by offshore wind and tide” (event type 2).

The historical hurricane event template window is shown in @fig-hurricaneTemplate. After a user selects a hurricane from the hurricane selector window, the event name and description of the hurricane and the timing will be automatically filled in. The user can edit these if desired. The tide and storm surge boundary conditions for the overland flood model will be modeled with the SFINCS offshore model using wind and pressure information associated with the selected hurricane track. The wind will be automatically obtained from the track information; the user does not need to supply this information. The user can select a track shift, which shifts a historical track in a horizontal or vertical direction by a user-specified number of miles. The rainfall is derived from the track using the IPET method. The river discharge represents the discharge at the model boundary and will be automatically filled to a default value specified during system set-up. The user can modify these values in the event template window. If there are multiple rivers at the model boundary, the user will be able to select each river to view or modify the discharge.
