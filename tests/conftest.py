    This fixture is used for testing in general.
    It functions as follows:
        1) Setup database controller
        2) Perform all tests in scope
        3) Optionally clean the database
    Scope can be one of the following: "function", "class", "module", "package", "session"

    Parameters
    ----------
    scope : str
        The scope of the fixture (e.g., "function", "class", "module", "package", "session")
    clean : bool, optional (default is True)
        Whether to clean the database after all tests in the scope have run.
        Clean means cleaning the contents of versioned files, and deleting unversioned files and folders after the tests

    Returns
    -------
    _db_fixture : pytest.fixture
        The database fixture
