    """
    This generates a fixture that is used for testing in general.
    All fixtures function as follows:
        1) Update the database to the latest revision
        2) Initialize database controller
        3) Perform all tests in scope
        4) Optionally clean the database

    Usage
    ----------
    To access the fixture in a test , you need to:
        1) pass the fixture name as an argument to the test function
        2) directly use as a the database object:
            def test_some_test(test_db):
                something = test_db.get_something()
                some_event_toml_path = test_db.input_path / "events" / "some_event" / "some_event.toml"
                assert ...
    Parameters
    ----------
    scope : str
        The scope of the fixture (e.g., "function", "class", "module", "package", "session")
    clean : bool, optional (default is True)
        Whether to clean the database after all tests in the scope have run.
        Clean means cleaning the contents of versioned files, and deleting unversioned files and folders after the tests

    Returns
    -------
    _db_fixture : pytest.fixture
        The database fixture used for testing
