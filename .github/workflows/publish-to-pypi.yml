# This workflow will build a Python package and publish it to PyPI when a new tag is created.
#
# Usage:
#  - Create a new tag with the version number in the format v*.*.* where * are integers.
#  - Push the tag to the repository with git push --tags
#
# Result:
#  - The workflow will check if the new version is greater than the latest version on PyPI
#  - The workflow will build the package and publish it to PyPI
#  - The workflow will also create a GitHub release with the tag name and the release notes

# Checklist for using this workflow up for a new project:
#   - In github settings:
#       - Create an environment called `release` and setup the permissions (https://github.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<REPO_NAME>/settings/environments)
#   - In this file,
#      - at the `env` section on line 34:
#        - Update the name of your package (PACKAGE_NAME)
#        - Update the version of Python you want to use (PYTHON_VERSION)
#  - In the setup_and_build job:
#      - Update the the shell commands to install your package
#  - In the pypi_publish job:
#      - Update the name of the environment to match the one created in the github settings
#  - On PyPi:
#      - Create the project and add a trusted publisher (https://pypi.org/manage/project/<PACKAGE_NAME>/settings/publishing/ or https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing if the project is not on pypi yet)
#      - Ensure the publisher is configured to use:
#          - environment name: `release` (can be changed, but should be the one created in the github settings)
#          - the filename of this workflow yml (in this case: publish-to-pypi.yml)
