    "text": "Overview\nFloodAdapt is a flood adaptation decision-support tool, which aims to advance and accelerate flooding-related adaptation planning. It integrates rapid, physics-based compound flood modeling and detailed impact modeling into a user-friendly system, ensuring accessibility for end-users, regardless of their technical backgrounds. This enables users to define and evaluate meaningful “what-if” scenarios, which can be combinations of weather events, climate or socio-economic future conditions, and adaptation strategies. FloodAdapt rapidly generates high-quality flood and impact maps, equity-focused aggregations, and informative metrics, providing valuable support for planning and facilitating genuine stakeholder engagement. Beyond its usefulness for end-users, FloodAdapt acts as a vital bridge between scientific advancements and practical needs, enhancing the adoption and impact of adaptation research and development.\n\nFloodAdapt was developed as a rapid planning tool with a straightforward graphical user interface for scenario generation, simulation, and visualization of spatial flooding and flooding impacts. Decision-making needs at the community level were central to the design of FloodAdapt. Users can answer planning questions like: “How will potential adaptation options reduce flood impacts?”, “How will those options perform for different types of events, like hurricanes, king tides, or heavy rainfall?”, “Which neighborhoods will benefit most?”, “How will those options hold up in the future?”\nUsers specify what-if scenarios composed of historic or synthetic weather events, climate or socio-economic future projections, and adaptation measures. They are able to evaluate flooding and impacts due to compound weather events, like hurricanes, king tides, and rainfall events. Users can evaluate flooding, impacts, and risk considering user-specified projections of sea level rise, precipitation increase, storm frequency increase, population growth, and economic growth. They can also test out adaptation options, like sea walls, levees, pumps, urban green infrastructure, home elevations, buyouts and floodproofing.\nThe backend of FloodAdapt leverages the open-source, state-of-the-art process-based compound flood model SFINCS that can accurately predict compound flooding due to surge, rainfall, and river discharge, at a fraction of the computation time typically required by physics-based models. The damage model included in FloodAdapt is the Deltares-developed open-source flood impact assessment tool Delft-FIAT. It calculates the flood damages to individual buildings and roads, and – when social vulnerability data is available – aggregates these damages over vulnerability classes.\nWhen a user specifies a what-if scenario, the backend of FloodAdapt automatically makes changes to the SFINCS and Delft-FIAT models to represent the user choices, the way an expert modeller would. It then simulates the scenario and returns flood and impact maps, scenario comparison visualizations, summary metrics, and an infographic to highlighting flooding or impacts of particular concern to a community. In this way, FloodAdapt allows end-users to unleash the power of advanced models without requiring the technical background, or the laborious pre- and post-processing of models that is usually required for this type of analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic showing the design concepts behind the FloodAdapt software"

    "section": "Intended Uses of FloodAdapt",
    "text": "Intended Uses of FloodAdapt\nFloodAdapt was developed to support adaptation and resilience planning, to provide community understanding of the flooding and impacts resulting from different scenarios of interest, to understand the urgency of actions in different areas, to prioritize investments, and to assess the effectiveness and longevity of different adaptation options.\nFloodAdapt is a powerful and physics-based system that can provide realistic flood and impact responses for user-defined scenarios. This is important because accuracy builds community trust in the tool. The underlying models and data in FloodAdapt can be continuously improved by the local or regional agencies who are operating it. The accuracy of the model results will depend on the accuracy of the input data. FloodAdapt can also help illuminate which data are missing or need improvement and should be collected when resources allow.\nFloodAdapt is not intended for use in the detailed engineering design of adaptation measures, particularly hydraulic ones. Once FloodAdapt has helped the community identify strategies and priority areas for improvements, the specific design requirements for these strategies should be done using more comprehensive modeling tools available. These may need to include detailed drainage infrastructure systems, groundwater, or other components not currently built into FloodAdapt."

The user enters a percentage (such as 10%) which represents the percentage of the current existing population.

This is because users may not know where new buildings will be built or which buildings will be replaced by higher-density buildings to support future population growth. FloodAdapt therefore spreads the increase evenly over the entire building stock, by increasing the maximum potential damages of all the existing buildings. Figure 2 shows an example how this is implemented, highlighting one building. This increase is applied to all buildings equally, so that the overall increase in damages is reflective of the future situation with population growth.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simplification of population growth in the existing built area in FloodAdapt"

    "text": "Population growth - new development areas\nTo evaluate future impacts of population growth specifically in new areas considered for development, users can choose the option “Population Growth - New (%)” (see Figure 3). This is an innovative feature of FloodAdapt which allows users to evaluate the flooding and impacts in areas considered for future development.\nThe user specifies the percentage of the current existing population that is projected to live in the new development area. For example, if the current population is 100,000, and the new development area is expected to support 1,000 new residents, the user would enter 1% for the population growth in the new area. The user is then asked to provide a shape file (or other spatial polygon file) specifying the boundaries of the new development area. In addition, the user can specify how high the new development will be built off the ground, either relative to a datum, or relative to base flood elevation (BFE). This allows users to explore the impact of regulations on how high new developments need to be built.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Entering a percentage population growth for a new development area\n\n\nThe idea of population growth in new areas in FloodAdapt is that people will move to currently-undeveloped areas which will be zoned for residential or commercial use to accommodate population growth. This feature allows users to evaluate potential new development areas in terms of the impacts and risk that result.\nThe implementation of population growth in new areas in FloodAdapt is simplified. The user is not expected to know exactly where each new building will be located, or specifics about each building that are typically needed to calculated damages, such as maximum potential damages, or whether they will be one-story or two-story homes. Instead, FloodAdapt creates a composite building over the entire new development area. This composite building is currently assumed to reflect the make-up of the existing built area. For example, if the current built area is 80% residential, 18% commercial, and 2% government buildings, the new development will have this same composition. The way this is utilized in FloodAdapt is that the composite new-development building is assigned a depth-damage curve that is a weighted average of the depth-damage curves of the existing buildings. The maximum potential damage of the composite building is assumed to be the total maximum potential damages over all the existing buildings multiplied by the percentage population growth. For example, if the total maximum potential damages over all buildings in the area is $1 Billion, the maximum potential damages for a new development area with 1% population growth would be $10 Million. Because the new-development composite building is large, it is likely often partially flooded during flood events. FloodAdapt stores the flood depths over the entire new development area. It takes the average flood depth to calculate damages, but reduces these damages by the fraction of the area that is not flooded. For example, if the average flood depth leads to damages of $1 Million, but only 20% of the area was flooded, FloodAdapt will reduce the damages by 80% to $200,000. Figure 4 gives a visual representation of how population growth in new development areas is represented in FloodAdapt.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Implementation of population growth in new development areas in FloodAdapt"

This is a simplification intended to represent increasing wealth and value in the community, without specifically accounting for changes in economic activity which would lead to this wealth and value increase.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Implementation of economic growth in FloodAdapt"

These options are configurable and are specified at system setup. Once you select a scenario, you specify a year and FloodAdapt will automatically calculate the sea level rise for that year, using the selected sea level rise scenario. You can then give your projection a name and (optionally) a description and click “OK” and your projection will show up in the FlodoAdapt Projections tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Using a sea level rise scenario and a year to enter a sea level rise projection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea level rise - since when?\n\n\n\nSea level rise scenarios have a starting point where sea level rise is zero (often, but not necessarily, starting at the year 2000). FloodAdapt corrects for this, using the ‘current year’, which is specified at system setup. So when a user chooses the “from scenario” option to input a sea level rise projection for a future year, the sea level rise that is shown in the projections window is relative to the current year. This is done by subtracting the projected rise between the starting point and the current year, for each sea level rise scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the sea level rise projection represented in the modeling?\n\n\n\nWhen a user runs a scenario with a sea level rise projection, the sea level rise is added to the flood model’s coastal boundary condition. FloodAdapt treats this addition differently depending on the type of event. For a recent event using gauged water levels, the sea level rise in the current year relative to mean sea level is already represented in the measured water levels, so only the relative rise between the current year and future year is added. For a recent event without gauged water levels and for a historical hurricane, the offshore model calculates the nearshore coastal water levels relative to mean sea level. To correct for the sea level rise in the current year relative to mean sea level, an ‘offset’ is added which is specified at system set-up. On top of this, the relative sea level rise between the current year and the future year is added to represent the future conditions."

This is because for a single event, a user can explore a ‘what-if’ scenario about increased rainfall by adjusting the rainfall when they define an event (with the precipitation magnifier for a historical event, or with complete flexibility in defining rainfall for a synthetic event). For probabilistic event sets, the precpitation change needs to be applied to every event in the set, something that the user cannot do via the events tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I choose this projection for a single event scenario?\n\n\n\nIf you choose a projection of increased precipitation for a single event, it will work exactly as expected, and is identical to the precipitation magnifier option when you define your event.

This percentage is treated as an increase in the occurrence frequency of each tropical storm event in a probabilistic event set. This influences the return period flood maps and risk estimates, because when storms occur more frequently, the chance of storm flooding, and hence risk, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample - increased storm frequency\n\n\n\nFor example, if you select a storm frequency increase of 10%, and a tropical storm in the event set had an occurrence frequency of once in 50 years (0.02), the increased frequency of this storm would be 0.22, or once in about 45 years.\n\n\n\nWhy is this only for probabilistic event sets?\nThe change in storm frequency will only affect the frequency of the storm. This frequency is used in the derivation of return period flood maps and the calculation of expected annual damages. For a single event, this frequency is not used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I choose this projection for a single event scenario?\n\n\n\nIf you choose a projection of increased storm frequency for a single event, it will have no effect. The frequency is only used when calculating return period flood maps and risk, and for a single event scenario will play no role. It won’t do any harm, but it won’t have any effect on the resulting event-scenario flood and impact results.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Entering increased storm frequency as a percentage increase"

The user specifies the peak surge, the duration of the surge, and the timing of the peak relative to T=0. Figure 3 shows an example how a user can adjust the surge timing. The figure shows three panels. The top panel has the tide set to zero, so the timeseries of the surge alone can be viewed. The surge is set as a Gaussian curve with a peak value of 6 ft, and a duration of 12 hours. The second panel shows the timing of the peak surge at -5 hours, with the tide set back to its default value of 3 ft. This is 5 hours before T=0, when the tide was not at its crest. The third panel shows the timing of the peak surge at 0 hours, which is precisely at T=0, when the tide was at its crest. You can s ee that the effect of the surge and high tide coinciding is a much higher total water level than when the peak surge occurs prior to the high tide.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: T=0 and the duration of a sythetic event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe zero point and the datums in the water level plots\n\n\n\nThere are several datums shown in the water level plot: mean lower low water (MLLW), mean sea level (MSL), and mean higher high water (MHHW). The zero point, which is set to mean lower low water (MLLW) in Figure 3, is configurable and chosen at system set-up to be most intuitive for the intended users of the system."

When creating a tailored Delft-FIAT model, you always start by building a base exposure dataset using open data, which can then be refined. The Delft-FIAT model tabs (see Figure x) — Exposure, Vulnerability, Equity, and Additional Attributes — enable specific refinements, which are highlighted in the list below and detailed in the following sections.\n\nStep 1: Set up a base exposure dataset\nExposure updates \n\nUpdate finished floor heights of buildings\nUpdate the ground elevation at the asset locations\nUpdate the maximum potential damages (structure and content) of the assets\n\nVulnerability\n\nAssign default vulnerability curves\nChange vulnerability curves\n\nEquity\n\nAdd income and population data for equity-weighting in FloodAdapt\n\nAdditional Attributes\n\nAdd flexible attributes that are important for deriving metrics or visualizing in FloodAdapt\n\n\n\nCreate a base exposure dataset\nSimilar to the Quick Build option, the base exposure dataset is generated using open data. When your model is within the United States, National Structure Inventory data is used to generate the base exposure dataset for buildings, and open street map (OSM) is used to generate the data for roads. When your model is outside of the United States, OSM is used to generate the base exposure dataset for both buildings and roads.\nTo set up the base exposure dataset:\n\nGenerate your model boundary.\nOpen the “Exposure” tab from the top panel. From the bottom panel select the “Asset Location” tab.\nSelect the correct data source for your model.\n\nFor a U.S. based model choose “Start with National Structure Inventory (NSI)”\nFor a model outside of the U.S. choose “Start with Open Street Map (OSM)”\n\nInclude road data by checking the checkbox “Include OSM roads”.\nClick the button “Add to model”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra settings for models outside the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhen choosing to start with open street map, the model-builder asks the user to specify a damage unit and a finished floor height.\n\nDamage unit (currency): Do not change the default currency from Euro to another currency. There is no currency converter tool implemented in the Delft-FIAT model builder yet.\nFinished floor height: OSM exposure data does not include this attribute. The user can select a single value that will be applied to all buildings. They can refine this later using spatial data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for setting up a base exposure dataset for a Delft-FIAT model in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nIf this video is not visible for you, try this link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for setting up a base exposure dataset for a Delft-FIAT model outside of the U.S.\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\nUpdating exposure data\nThe Delft-FIAT model builder allows you to update the following exposure data, covered in the following sections. Click on any of the options to jump to that section:\n\nFinished floor heights\nGround elevation\nMaximum potential damages\n\n\nUpdating finished floor heights\nFinished floor heights refer to the height of the ground floor of a building above ground level. Damage estimates are sensitive to this attribute, and open data is either not available (in the case of OSM) or is not entirely reliable (in the case of NSI). When local data exists on building elevations, these can be incorporated in the Delft-FIAT model using the Delft-FIAT model-builder. The finished floor height data must be point or polygon data (e.g. .gpkg, .geojson).\n\nTo refine the finished floor heights using the Delft-FIAT model-builder:\n\nOpen the Exposure tab from the top panel and select the Finished Floor Height tab in the bottom panel.\nClick the button “Select Source” and choose the point or polygon file with your finished floor height data.\nClick the “Load” button. This will load the data field names in your file into the “Attribute ID” drop-down menu.\nIn the “Attribute ID” drop-down menu, select the field name that corresponds to your finished floor height data.\nClick “Add to model”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional settings for spatially joining exposure points and finished floor height data\n\n\n\nIn the “Finished Floor Height” tab there is a “Settings” button. This allows you to change default choices related to the spatial join of the exposure data points and the uploaded finished floor height data. Default settings use the nearest method for points and the intersection method for polygons when doing the spatial join. The default maximum distance for the nearest method is 10 meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for updating the finished floor height of buildings in your Delft-FIAT model\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\nUpdating ground elevation\nTo update ground elevation data, you must provide a digital elsevation model (DEM) raster file. The Delft-FIAT model builder calculates the mean elevation within the shape of each asset and assigns this value to the associated asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant note for those who will use the FloodAdapt database builder\n\n\n\nIf you will use the FloodAdapt database builder to create your FloodAdapt database, it will automatically overwrite the ground elevation data in your Delft-FIAT model to match what is in your SFINCS model, so you do not need to do that manually here!\n\n\n\nTo update the ground elevation values in your Delft-FIAT model:\n\nOpen the Exposure tab on the top panel and select the Ground Elevation tab in the bottom panel.\nSelect a ground elevation source. There are two options in the drop-down menu:\n\nSFINCS Ground Elevation\n\nIf you have already a SFINCS model set up, select the folder that contains your SFINCS model. The Delft-FIAT model builder knows the location of the DEM file within this folder.\n\nUpload file\n\nSelect a DEM raster file\nSelect the elevation unit for your DEM (meters or feet).\n\n\nClick “Add to model”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for updating ground elevation in your Delft-FIAT model\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\nUpdating maximum potential damages\nWhen local data is available on maximum potential values, either for content or structure, these can be incorporated in the Delft-FIAT model using the Delft-FIAT model-builder. The maximum potential damages you want to use must be point or polygon data. Point data would be for asset-level information, and polygon data would be for cases where you want to assign the same values to a larger area. It is necessary to distinguish between structure and content maximum potential damages, as these are treated separately in the damage calculation.\n\nTo update the maximum potential damages:\n\nOpen the Exposure tab on the top panel and select the Max Potential Damages tab in the bottom panel.\nClick “Select source” and select the file containing your maximum potential damage data (point or polygon data)\nClick “Load”. This will load the data columns in your file into the “Attribute ID” drop-down menu.\nSelect the column that holds the max. potential damage data.\nSelect the damage type you wish to update, either “structure” or “content”.\nAdd to model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional settings for spatially joining exposure points and maximum potential damages\n\n\n\nIn the “Max Potential Damages” tab there is a “Settings” button. This allows you to change default choices related to the spatial join of the exposure data points and the uploaded finished floor height data. Default settings use the nearest method for points and the intersection method for polygons when doing the spatial join. The default maximum distance for the nearest method is 10 meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for updating the maximum potential damages in your Delft-FIAT model\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability curves\nDelft-FIAT uses vulnerability curves (also known as depth-damage curves) to relate inundation depths to a fraction of total damage. Each building type can have a different depth-damage curve. Delft-FIAT accepts any user-selected or defined depth-damage curve. To make it easy for users to quickly set up a Delft-FIAT model, there is a default damage curve assignment in the Delft-FIAT model-builder. Figure 2 shows the selection of default depth-damage curves (for structure damage) for buildings in the United States. This selection can be changed by the user. To assign the default damage curves, you only need to do the following two steps:\n\nOpen the Vulnerability tab on the top panel. The default damage curves are already selected.\nClick “Add to model”\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Default selection of structure depth-damage curves for Delft-FIAT models built in locations in the United States. More discussion about this default selection will be coming soon as will an overview of the default curves for content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for adding depth damage curves to your Delft-FIAT model\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\nUpdating vulnerability curves\nIf you are building your model in the U.S., you can change the damage curve assignment. Updating damage curves is currently only possible in the U.S. The functionality is facilitated by the alignment between HAZUS damage curves and the secondary object types in the National Structure Inventory (see secondary object types in Figure 3). Users can only choose new damage curve assignments from existing damage curves within the HAZUS damage curve database. User-defined damage curves are currently not possible from within the Delft-FIAT model builder. Future releases of the Delft-FIAT model builder may offer more flexibility.\n\nHow to change the damage curve assignment (U.S. only):\n\nOpen the Vulnerability tab on the top panel\nClick “Specify different damage curves”. A pop-up window appears. In the pop-up window:\n\nSelect from the left panel the secondary object type for which you want to change the damage curve\nSelect a damage curve from the upper right panel (source is HAZUS database); the damage curve will be plotted in the lower right panel\nClick “Select Source” underneath the upper right panel to assign the selected damage curve.\nContinue the above procedure for all secondary object types for which you would like to change the curve.\nWhen finished, click “OK” to close the pop-up window.\n\nClick “Add to model” to complete.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Secondary occupancy type definitions from the HAZUS technical manual, Table 3.2. Note: “occupancy class” and “object type” are used interchangeably.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for changing depth-damage curves for a U.S. Delft-FIAT model\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity\nFloodAdapt allows you to evaluate equity-weighted damages and benefits. To prepare the income and population data needed to calculate equity weights, per capita income and population are obtain from the U.S. Census Bureau at the block group scale. Adding this data to your Delft-FIAT model is easy, and described in the steps below:\n\nOpen the Equity tab on the top panel.\nIn the bottom panel, specify the year you for which census data will be downloaded.\nCheck the checkbox to download Equity data.\nClick “Add to model”\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Attributes\n\n\nFloodAdapt allows users to tailor-define metrics that will be automatically calculated when scenarios are run. An example metric is “number of homes impacted for families with low income brackets”, or “number of homes impacted who live in a FEMA flood zone”. To facilitate the calculation of tailored metrics, additional layers (in these examples, a spatial income layer or a FEMA flood zone map) can be added to your Delft-FIAT model. Any additional layer (e.g. landuse, administrative boundaries) can be added to your model.\n\nTo add an additional attribute layer to your model:\n\nOpen the Additional Attributes tab on the top panel.\nClick “Select source” and choose your file.\nClick “Load”. This will load the data columns in your file into the “Attribute ID” drop-down menu.\nFrom the “Attribute ID” drop-down, select the attribute you wish to add to your model.\nAdd a name in the “Label” box. This label will be the column name of your attribute in the Delft-FIAT exposure (and output) data.\nClick “Add”. The layer will appear in the table in the “Overview attribute” table.\nIn the bottom of the “Overview attribute” panel, you can check the “Display Attribute” checkbox to verify your data was added correctly.\nYou can repeat this process for as many layers as you wish.\nWhen finished adding layers, click “Add to model”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch a video tutorial for adding additional attributes to your Delft-FIAT model\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\nCreate model\nAt this point you are ready to create your Delft-FIAT model. Open the Create Model tab on the top panel and verify the data sources in the bottom tab are as expected. If so, click “Create Delft-FIAT model”."

    "text": "Delft-FIAT is the open-source flood impact model implemented in FloodAdapt. When setting up FloodAdapt in a new location, it is required to first set up a Delft-FIAT model in the project area. This is considered the ‘baseline’ Delft-FIAT model, which FloodAdapt users can then modify through the FloodAdapt user interface - for example, by elevating buildings. Figure 1 shows the flood impact modeling concept on which Delft-FIAT is based. It relates a hazard (the flood waters), exposure (buildings or roads that might be flooded), and vulnerability (the propensity of assets to be damaged when flooded).\nFigure 2 illustrates how damages are calculated in Delft-FIAT. The steps involved in a Delft-FIAT calculation are:\nDelft-FIAT is considered a ‘calculation engine’, which means it is designed to make damage calculations, but does not come prepopulated with data. When we say ‘setting up a Delft-FIAT model’ for a project location, this refers to collecting and formatting exposure and vulnerability data for the area. This document provides an overview of the data needed to set up a Delft-FIAT model, and a user guide on how to build a Delft-FIAT model in your project location using the Delft-FIAT model-builder. This model-builder makes it easy to rapidly prepare a Delft-FIAT model using open data, but also supports tailored model-building by allowing you to bring in local or more accurate data when available."

They are very useful for gaining insight, but not required; if they are not provided, FloodAdapt users will still be able to use all of the FloodAdapt functionality.\nThe secondary occupancy type can be optional, but will sometimes be required. The primary and secondary occupancy types tell Delft-FIAT which depth-damage curves should be used for which building. When the depth-damage curves are defined by the secondary occupancy type, this will be a required input. This is the case when using HAZUS damage curves. When using other damage curves, such as those from the Joint Research Center, which are identified only on primary object type, the secondary object type will be optional.\n\n\nVulnerability data in Delft-FIAT are captured in depth-damage curves. These translate inundation depths at an asset to a fraction of total damage (Figure 4). The depth-damage curve is related to the building type (e.g. ‘residential 1-story building’) and the inundation depth during a flood event. Different types of assets incur different degrees of damage at varying inundation levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Example of depth-damage functions."

The user can see all hurricanes within a specified distance of the site, or between specified years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHurricanes far offshore\n\n\n\nIt is not recommended to use the Historical hurricane option for a hurricane that passed far offshore of the site. In those cases, it is recommended to use the “Historical event without gauged water levels” event type.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hurricane selector window. You can search by name, and can filter the selection by distance to the site or time window\n\n\nThe historical hurricane event template window is shown in Figure 2. After a user selects a hurricane from the hurricane selector window, the event name and description of the hurricane and the timing will be automatically filled in. The user can edit these if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing the hurricane start and stop time\n\n\n\nThe autommatically filled-in start and stop time represent the entire duration of the hurricane track. This event duration can be shortened to speed up the calculation. How should you pick the duration? Hover your mouse over the track icons to see date and time stamps. Choose dates from 1-2 days before landfall to 1 day after landfall.\n\n\nUnder the “Surge and Tide” block, the user can shift the hurricane track by specifying the miles of horizontal or vertical shift. The shifted hurricane will be displayed beside the original track.\nThe wind and rain are automatically derived from information about the hurricane track. The rainfall is derived from the track using the IPET method. The user does not need to specify any information here.\nThe river discharge represents the discharge at the model boundary and will be automatically filled to a default value specified during system set-up. The user can modify this value. If there are multiple rivers at the model boundary, the user will be able to select each river to view or modify the discharge.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Event template window for a historical hurricane.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "A probabilistic event set is the combination of a set of synthetic events and their occurrence probabilities. These can be both tropical storms (hurricanes), as well as non-tropical events. They should include all event types that can lead to flooding in the site area (now or in the future), and can be compound flood events, meaning a combination of different flood drivers, like water level, rainfall, river discharge, or wind. It can be complicated to set up this set of events, and is therefore recommended to be done by an expert during the set-up of FloodAdapt for the site location.\nIn the events tab in FloodAdapt, a probabilistic event set can be recognized by the Type specification at the bottom of the window (see Figure 1). These event sets cannot be modified or deleted via the user interface.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Probabilistic event set in the Events window. The Type is specified as Probabilistic Event Set and cannot be modified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are probabilistic event sets used in FloodAdapt?\n\n\n\nWhen a user selects a scenario with a probabilistic event set, FloodAdapt calculate return period flood maps (such as the 100 year flood map), return period damages, and expected annual damages (risk) for the scenario. For example, if a user wants to explore the risk with 1 foot of sea level rise with a floodwall in place, their scenario components would be: projection = 1 ft. sea level rise, strategy = floodwall, event = probabilistic event set. The calculation of risk allows a user to explore the risk-reduction benefits of adaptation options, as well as obtaining more comprehensive insight into how at-risk different areas are when considering all relevant event types and their probability of occurring. The page on scenarios gives more examples how users can define scenarios to answer different questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This shows the buildings that are in the exposure data of the impact model within FloodAdapt.\nEach of the building-level measures allows users to specify a property type to which the measure should be applied. So, for example, if a user selects a neighborhood, but only wants to apply the measure to the residential properties within the neighborhood, they are able to specify this. The property type is linked to an attribute in the impact model called the ‘primary object type’. In the U.S, these are typically residential (RES) commercial (COM), industrial (IND), or public (PUB). You can also choose to apply the measure to all the buildings in the selected area."

The user can select the datum; in this case, the elevation is the elevation of the finished floor of the property above the specific datum. The user can also select to elevate properties relative to “Base Flood Elevation” (BFE). In this case the elevation is actually a height above this reference. In the U.S, BFE is a regulatory flood level that is related to insurance, and is often used in ordinances on how high new development must be built. In areas of the world where this is not used, the base flood elevation option may not be visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is elevating properties represented in the modeling?\n\n\n\nThe exposed assets have multiple attributes, one of which is the height of the finished floor above the ground. When a user elevates properties, FloodAdapt adjusts this attribute for the selected properties to represent the user specifications. Whether a user specifies a property elevation as an elevation relative to a datum, or a height above a reference level like base flood elevation, FloodAdapt calculates for each selected property the equivalent height above the ground, and assigns this value to the finished floor height attribute of the elevated property. For example, if a user selects 12 feet above datum, and the ground elevation where a property is located is 10 feet above datum, FloodAdapt calculates that the finished floor height of the property as 2 feet, and assigns this as the finished floor height attribute of the elevated property. Similarly, if a user selects 2 feet above BFE, and the BFE at the location of a property is 9 feet, then the property must be raised to 11 feet relative to datum. If the ground elevation at that location is 8 feet, FloodAdapt would calculate that the finished floor height for the elevated property is 3 feet."

However, the implementation in FloodAdapt does not actually remove the properties from the exposure data; instead, the selected properties are assigned a maximum potential damage value of zero. The damage is calculated as the damage fraction (based on the inundation depth) multiplied by the maximum potential damage.

When a user selects a floodproofing height, there will be no damage to the property until the inundation depths exceed that height. This is represented by modifying the depth-damage curve so that the damage fraction is zero below the floodproofing height. Above the floodproofing height, the damage curve is unchanged because once the inundation exceeds the floodproofing height, it is assumed the water will then enter the property and reach the levels it would have reached without the floodproofing barrier."
